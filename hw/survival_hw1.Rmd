```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(survival)
library(ggsurvfit)
library(dplyr)
```


## (Q1)

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("survival_hw1p1.png")
```


## (Q2.1)

`time` = survival time.  
`status` (=1) censored indicator.  
Use `sex` as group indicator,  

Test if the survival curves for the two groups are the same.  

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung) |> 
  ggsurvfit() +
  labs(
    x = "Time (in days)",
    y = "Survival probability"
  ) + 
  add_confidence_interval()
```

Visually, there appears to be a difference between the survival probabilities of
men and women.  
Let's do a formal KM test. 

```{r}
myfit <- survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
(myfit)
```

We can see that the difference between the two survival curves seems to be statistically significant with a log-rank test with a critical test statistic of 10.3 ($pval < 0.05$).




## (Q2.2). 
Give the KM estimator of the survival function and its 95% confidence intervals

```{r}
summary(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung))
```
